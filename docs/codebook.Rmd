### Background

This file describes the dataset `2017_prospective-ages.csv` which contains the calculated prospective old age thresholds for 241 countries and regions, 1950---2100, as well as the proportions of the population (male, female and total) over this threshold. 

For background see @Sanderson2008. 

The data was used in @mz2018, which is accessible [here](PH14.02.Factsheets/docs/presentations/PH14.02.Factsheet.pdf).

The methods of analysis used to produce the data are available here. 

The dataset is deposited on figshare here.

The original data used in the calculations @un2017 

* UN World Population Prospects [Standard Projections]; accessed `r format(file.info(here::here("data/01_raw/WPP2017_PBSAS.csv"))$ctime,format='%d.%m.%Y')`

* UN Life Tables---Mortality Indicators;  accessed `r format(file.info(here::here("data/01_raw/WPP2017_PBSAS.csv"))$ctime,format='%d.%m.%Y')`

## Description of dataset

### Rows

Each row is a location-time combination e.g.: *Algeria-1956*. There are 241 locations and 151 times, giving a total of 36391 rows.

### Columns

1. **location**---name of the region, subregion, country or area [string].
* 241 unique names
* Source:  @un2017 

2. **time**---single year for which the data refer to [numeric]. 
* range: 1950---2100
* Source:  @un2017 

3. **female**---old age threshold for women [numeric]. 
* Data randomly cross-checked with  @scherbov2018aging.
* Source: own calculation using splines from abridged life-tables.

4. **male**---old age threshold for men [numeric]. 
* Data randomly cross-checked with  @scherbov2018aging.
* Source: own calculation using splines from abridged life-tables.

5. **total**---old age threshold for both sexes [numeric]. 
* Data sanity-checked with 3. and 4. 
* Source: own calculation using splines from abridged life-tables.

6. **prop.over.65.total**---proportion of total population aged 65 or over.
* Data randomly cross-checked with [World Bank Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS)
* Source: own calculation using WPP standard projections. 

7. **prop.over.t.total**---proportion of total population older than old age threshold [**total** above].
* For three countries was possible to visually cross-check with @scherbov2018aging, in all cases theirs are slightly higher.
* Source: own calculation using splines from abridged life-tables and WPP standard projections. 

8. **prop.over.65.male**---proportion of male population aged 65 or over.
* Data randomly cross-checked with [World Bank Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS)[^1]
* Source: own calculation using WPP standard projections. 

9. **prop.over.t.male**---proportion of the male population older than the male old age threshold [**female** above].
* Source: own calculation using splines from abridged life-tables and WPP standard projections. 

10. **prop.over.65.female**---proportion of male population aged 65 or over.
* Data randomly cross-checked with [World Bank Data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS)$^1$
* Source: own calculation using WPP standard projections. 

11. **prop.over.t.female**---proportion of the male population older than the male old age threshold [**female** above].
* Source: own calculation using splines from abridged life-tables and WPP standard projections. 


[^1]: The huge majority of the checks were correct to 7 significant digits. There were a few discrepancies however, to the tune of 0.1-0.5 percentage point (e.g Malawi females). These are ascribed to WB perhaps using an earlier version of the data. Given the preponderance of the evidence the calculations performed here are correct, however the results are only as reliable as the original data.
