1. OK, basic outline copied from original factsheet, now needs cleaning up.

2. Renamed the data folders and couldn't get `make dot` to work, turns out that's because the `dot2png.R` file had hardcoded paths. This needs to be changed: 

* The makefile must pass the paths to the file. How do I do that again?
* Actually this question is about how to pass arguments from the command line. Let's try [this](http://tuxette.nathalievilla.org/?p=1696) source. 
* OK, so using `commandAgrs` in R works, it picks up anything after the `Rscripts` command, and makes it avaylable in R. 
* Now the only problem I have is that the path I am trying to pass has a `./` at its start in the makefile, but not in R. Used string substitution: `$(string:pattern=replacement)` so `$(DT03:./%=%)` to remove the `./`

3. Now streamline the makefile to get rid of all the factsheet stuff. I'll remove the journal as well. 

4. Also don't forget to include the fact that you know now that multiple targets do not lead to multiple executions of the rules, only multiple printouts using the `-n` option. 

5. 01-import OK, run to interim, so that downloads and saved data to interim are done. This takes a while, since I't downloading all 250MB of data. 

6. In the meantime looking at 02_transform. I am not clear why I use the `FunSpline` function when the spline function seems to do what I want?
