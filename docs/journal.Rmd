1. OK, basic outline copied from original factsheet, now needs cleaning up.

2. Renamed the data folders and couldn't get `make dot` to work, turns out that's because the `dot2png.R` file had hardcoded paths. This needs to be changed: 

* The makefile must pass the paths to the file. How do I do that again?
* Actually this question is about how to pass arguments from the command line. Let's try [this](http://tuxette.nathalievilla.org/?p=1696) source. 
* OK, so using `commandAgrs` in R works, it picks up anything after the `Rscripts` command, and makes it avaylable in R. 
* Now the only problem I have is that the path I am trying to pass has a `./` at its start in the makefile, but not in R. Used string substitution: `$(string:pattern=replacement)` so `$(DT03:./%=%)` to remove the `./`

3. Now streamline the makefile to get rid of all the factsheet stuff. I'll remove the journal as well. 

4. Also don't forget to include the fact that you know now that multiple targets do not lead to multiple executions of the rules, only multiple printouts using the `-n` option. 

5. 01-import OK, run to interim, so that downloads and saved data to interim are done. This takes a while, since I't downloading all 250MB of data. 

6. In the meantime looking at 02_transform. I am not clear why I use the `FunSpline` function when the spline function seems to do what I want?

# Tuesday 14.8.18

Notes on publication:

*[Research Data Journal for the Humanities and Social Sciences](http://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/24523666) might be intersting, although it seems pretty new and not really doing such niche things. 

*[Scientific Data](https://www.nature.com/sdata/publish#templates) with Nature looks great, but you need to pay, plus it is aimed at bioinformatics and the like. But good template "Data Descriptor" - see also in `\literature` folder for template. 

*[Open Health Data](https://openhealthdata.metajnl.com/) might actually be best bet. With an excellent example of some guy who cleaned up the WHO mortality database (a bit) and made it available [here](https://openhealthdata.metajnl.com/articles/10.5334/ohd.ao/)

*[Data](http://www.mdpi.com/journal/data/special_issues/spatial_denominator) is also a data journal, but not social sciences based, although there was an interesting call for papers on grid population datasets, so keep that in mind!

OK, so where was I?

1. `.gitignore`

2. What was the difference between FunSPline and spline? OK, so it seems that `spline()` cannot take the "mono" method. And I want to use that one, since it means the function is monotonically increasing, and also since the data fit the IIASA factsheet. That is for calculating the threshold. 

3. So I will best use the "mono" function for the rest of the interpolation as well! OK

4. See if I can't get 1950-2100 data instead of 1953-2098. OK

5. SO having added the extra years at the start and end, the mono funciton makes a big difference there especially. So yeah, FunSPline all the way. 

6. Next step: getting the populations sizes at the threshold age: I only did that for both genders together, but it would make sense to do it for them separately as well? 

7. First I'll just go back and clear up the `pop` dataset - it has too many variables i don't need. 

8. Now split the population size exptrapolation into three threads, one for each group. (Could probably be done in a more modular way, but this is too non-standard evaluation teritory for my lady brain). 

9. OK, popoulations at threshold age are now caclulated, now just find the ones over or under. 

10. Double check with the MENA data for both genders together - looks good (at least in Algeria). 

11. Careful, the demo data files might need following up since i've changed the variable names. 

12. In joining three tables the use of suffix is not great - it only works if the variable names are the same, but if you've already joined two tables, then they aren't any more, and it doesn't force the suffix.

13. LEQ 65 or < 65?!?!?! 

# Wednesday 15.8.2018

1. OK, so clearly we are intersted in people aged 65 and over, so my previous versions were wrong, since the under were LEQ 65 instead. OK, and this has now been double checked with [World Bank data](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.65UP.TO.ZS?end=2017&start=1960&view=chart) which is based on the 2017 WPP, so the calculations done now are correct. 

2. So how does the makefile look now?? the `interim` was just temporary, wasn't it?

3. OK, fix up `methods.Rmd` in line with the cahnegs to 02_transofrm from yesterday, esp. spline function and variable names. 

4. Oh man, cleaning makefiles - it's really tricky since there are no errors if e.g. a filename i named doesn't actually exist.. So i renamed a few files and didn't update the makefile, and that takes ages to figure out.. 

5. OK, methods are OK. 

6. Now this is the repo for the prospective age data, so no need to save the population data. But because I need those int eh factsheet I need to move that part of the code there. 

7. And in the factsheet have to now import the `prospective_age` data instead of transforming it there.  Also, there won't be any methods file there any more!! Or rather it is only compiled here, in the data repo, but I could link to it there as well. 

8. OK, tried to clear out the data transform code in the spreadsheets and turns out i got the zigzaggy proportions over the threshold again... Apparently that's because of the <= threshold! Fixed.

9. Rerun whole factsheet, fingers crossed. All good. Commit. 

10. Still has a manual copy of the data, I'll download it from figshare as soon as I deposit this there for the first time. 

11. What next. I need a codebook?

12. But first, set up the github/figshare setup! So here are some things:

* i can add a github repo as an "item" on figshare and set it to automatically update at each new release.
* aha, so on github I can have releases!
* but then it's the whole repo that has a DOI
* what if i want a fileset with the data, the codebook and the methods instead. 

13. OK, actually, I really hate the use of capitalisation in the variable names, so that needs to be cleaned up! Done that, but that will have reprecussions in the factsheet code as well.. I think that's all sorted now. Factsheet works great. Commit now. 

14. OK, so codebook. 

15. ToDO: region identifiers

16. ToDo: other measures?
